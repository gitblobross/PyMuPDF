This project is focused on analyzing legal memos using PyMuPDF. Please prioritize generating Python code for:

1. Extracting text from PDF files.
2. Identifying and analyzing key sections such as headers, footers, and body text.
3. Performing keyword searches and generating summaries.
4. Handling legal-specific formatting and terminology.

Avoid generating code unrelated to PDF analysis or legal memo processing.
