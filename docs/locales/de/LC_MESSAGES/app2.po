"Starting with version 1.4, PDF supports embedding arbitrary files as part"
" (\"Embedded File Streams\") of a PDF document file (see chapter \"7.11.4"
" Embedded File Streams\", pp. 103 of the :ref:`AdobeManual`)."

"In many aspects, this is comparable to concepts also found in ZIP files "
"or the OLE technique in MS Windows. PDF embedded files do, however, *not*"
" support directory structures as does the ZIP format. An embedded file "
"can in turn contain embedded files itself."

"Advantages of this concept are that embedded files are under the PDF "
"umbrella, benefitting from its permissions / password protection and "
"integrity aspects: all data, which a PDF may reference or even may be "
"dependent on, can be bundled into it and so form a single, consistent "
"unit of information."

"In addition to embedded files, PDF 1.7 adds *collections* to its support "
"range. This is an advanced way of storing and presenting meta information"
