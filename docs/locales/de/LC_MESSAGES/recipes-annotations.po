"Ink annotations are used to contain freehand scribbling. A typical "
"example may be an image of your signature consisting of first name and "
"last name. Technically an ink annotation is implemented as a **list of "
"lists of points**. Each point list is regarded as a continuous line "
"connecting the points. Different point lists represent independent line "
"segments of the annotation."
