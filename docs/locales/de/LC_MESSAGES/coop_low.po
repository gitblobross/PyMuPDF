"A :ref:`DisplayList` represents an interpreted document page. Methods for"

" page must be rendered several times (e.g. because of changed zoom "
"levels), or if text search and text extraction should both be performed, "
"overhead can be saved, if the display list is created only once and then "
"used for all other tasks."
